# QA → AI Decision & Ownership Roadmap

A structured decision and governance framework for applying AI testing responsibly in modern QA systems.

This roadmap complements execution-focused AI testing guides by introducing a decision-making layer around ownership, autonomy, risk, and operational responsibility.

---

## Why This Roadmap Exists

AI systems introduce uncertainty, probabilistic behavior, autonomy, and new risk surfaces.  
Traditional deterministic QA models are insufficient when systems:

- make decisions
- select tools
- retry actions
- operate under uncertainty

This roadmap helps QA professionals transition from validating outputs to governing behavior.

## What This Framework Covers

The roadmap is structured across maturity levels:

- **Mindset Shift** — Moving from deterministic to probabilistic thinking  
- **When NOT to Use AI** — Avoiding unnecessary complexity  
- **Ownership & Decision Boundaries** — Clarifying QA, Dev, and Product roles  
- **Human-in-the-Loop Strategies** — Oversight in uncertain systems  
- **AI Agents Reality** — Autonomy, irreversibility, system behavior  
- **Trust, Risk & Governance** — Accountability and operational responsibility  
- **QA Maturity in AI Systems** — Scaling AI quality responsibly

## Companion to AI LLM Testing Playbook

This framework is designed to complement execution-focused AI testing methodologies such as the AI LLM Testing Playbook (Phases 0–9).

- The Playbook explains **how to test AI systems**  
- This roadmap clarifies **when, why, and under whose ownership those practices apply**

Together, they form a complete AI QA model:

**Execution + Decision & Governance**

## How to Use This Roadmap

This roadmap can be used:

1. Before AI adoption — to assess necessity and risk.
2. During AI implementation — to align ownership and oversight.
3. At the organizational level — to evaluate AI QA maturity.

It is designed as a living framework and will evolve as AI systems mature.
